StarClinch - Post Your Requirement
=================

A web-app made using CSS and JS that displays an easy to use form where users can post their requiremnent. 

The app accepts two optional query parameters:
- `type` - to identify the type of the user
- `email` - the email of the user

The app, when opened with the above two parameters, triggers an event to the database. This functionality is useful to catch drop-offs. 

`js/get-quote.js` contains the main logic of the app.
